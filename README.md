During the difficult Covid times when people are stuck at their homes, managing their health becomes a challenge.
To solve this problem, I created an application called 7 Minute Workout.
This is a simple application with Easy UI for people to stretch their bodies and warm-up in just 7 Minutes.
The key features of this application includes, Text to Speech foe each exercise, ie the user does not have to look into his/her screen to check which exercise is next.
Database which keeps track of the date and time of workouts performed by the user.
A BMI calculator in 2 different units, keeping track of the Body Mass Index of the user.
